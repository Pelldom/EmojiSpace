ideas:
event - while mining discover a hollow asteroid that can be used as secure stash location (0% chance of discovery/seizure)
cargo - mass and volume? some cargo could be too volumnous for some ships, where data cargo has no mass at all. 

refactor - shipdock for repair and buy/sell ships and modules
refactor - all destinations able to refuel ships
refactor - add salvage of modules as possible reward

world gen - confirm LY distances between systems. set 1-5? UI will need to display map of relative positions of stars
	- UI will need to display list or map of available Destinations within a system
	- Ui will need to display list or map of available Locations within a Destination
DONE - data structure - consolodate files
	- tags.json
DONE - need to update for updated tags!
DONE - reward resolution
DONE - mission life cycle
	- add more reward types
	- add more mission types
exploration destinations
missing - non-enhabited Destinations (asteroids, abandoned ships/stations, etc)
missing - non-combat encounters (random and fixed)
missing - mining asteroids
